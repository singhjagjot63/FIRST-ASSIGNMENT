                    n computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that each return a value, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which change the state of the program or world.

                    The lambda calculus, developed in the 1930s by Alonzo Church, is a formal system of computation built from function application. In 1937 Turing proved that the lambda calculus and Turing machines are equivalent models of computation,[29] showing that the lambda calculus is Turing complete. Lambda calculus forms the basis of all functional programming languages. An equivalent theoretical formulation, combinatory logic, w

                   Information Processing Language (IPL), 1956, is sometimes cited as the first computer-based functional programming language.[35] It is an assembly-style language for manipulating lists of symbols. It does have a notion of generator, which amounts to a function that accepts a function as an argument, and, since it is an assembly-level language, code can be data, so IPL can be regarded as having higher-order functions. However, it relies heavily on mutating list structure and similar imperative features.
